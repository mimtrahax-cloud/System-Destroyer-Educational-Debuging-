# System-Destroyer-Educational-Debuging-
This project is a safe Bash script that pretends to delete important system files on Linux or Android. While it looks like it is removing /system, /init, or even killing processes, in reality it does absolutely nothing harmful. Instead, it shows a fake progress bar, simulated log messages, and ends with a light-hearted message.
